## Running the App

You can access the live site at this URL: https://mlbstats.vercel.app/ (no longer supported)

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Node.js and npm

### Setting up the Server
1. Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the `server` directory.
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the server-side dependencies.
3. Run `python app.py` to start the Flask server.

### Setting up the Front End
1. Open another terminal or command prompt window and navigate to the `src` directory.
2. Run `npm install` to install the front-end dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to start the development server.

After following these steps, you should be able to access the app by navigating to `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser. The Flask server will be running on `https://lionfish-app-q5lpr.ondigitalocean.app/`. If you would like to host the server locally, change the routes in each of the fetches to 'http://localhost:5000'
